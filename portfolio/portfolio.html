        <h1 class="project-title">1) Recommendation system </h1>
        <p class="project-content">Recommendation Systems employs a data-driven methodology to offer customers tailored recommendations. 
            It uses user data and algorithms to forecast and suggest goods, services, or content that a user is probably going to find interesting. 
            These systems are essential in applications where users may become overwhelmed by large volumes of information, such as social media, streaming services, and e-commerce. 
            Building recommendation systems is a common use for Python because of its modules and machine learning frameworks. 
            The two main kinds are content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. 
            Hybrid strategies that integrate the two approaches are also popular. 
            These kinds of systems improve user experiences, boost user involvement, and propel corporate expansion.

        <h1 class="project-title">2) SMS Spam Detection Using Tensorflow</h1>
        <p class="project-content"> practically everyone has a mobile phone, and they all get communications (SMS/ email) on their phone regularly. 
            But the essential point is that majority of the messages received will be spam, with only a few being ham or necessary communications. 
            Scammers create fraudulent text messages to deceive you into giving them your personal information, such as your password, account number, or Social Security number. 
            If they have such information, they may be able to gain access to your email, bank, or other accounts.
